# Tabular Data Analysis and Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing and building models for tabular data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training. The implementation is done in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Import Required Libraries
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. These libraries are used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### 2. Data Loading
- **Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Preview**: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to understand its structure.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Summary Statistics**: Key statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are calculated.
- **Missing Values**: The dataset is checked for missing values, and appropriate handling techniques are applied.
- **Visualizations**: Various plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are created to understand data distributions and relationships.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- **Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Scaling**: Numerical features are scaled using standardization or normalization.
- **Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### 5. Feature Engineering
- **New Features**: Additional features are created based on domain knowledge.
- **Feature Selection**: Irrelevant or redundant features are removed to improve model performance.

### 6. Model Training
- **Algorithms**: Various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests are used.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search or random search is applied to find the best hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 7. Results
- **Model Comparison**: The performance of different models is compared.
- **Best Model**: The best-performing model is selected and saved for future use.
